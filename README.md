==============

These materials were developed for Stat 202 at Williams College in the fall of 2024 by Anna Neufeld.

They are based off of the OpenIntro lab templates. The textbook as well as the html version of the labs can
be found at [http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php](http://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php). In particular, the template and some content on this cite is taken from the tidyverse version of the OpenIntro labs [https://openintrostat.github.io/oilabs-tidy/](https://openintrostat.github.io/oilabs-tidy/).
