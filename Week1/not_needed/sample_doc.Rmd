```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Getting started

This is my first RMarkdown document. I want to see if I can create a PDF document that contains text and R code. 

```{r}
5+8
```

When I knit this, hopefully my PDF document will contain the printed number 13! 

### More advanced

Let's try one more chunk~

```{r}
x = 5+7
y = 10-3
x-y
```

What do you see when you knit the PDF document? 

### Bonus

What happens if you remove the line ``x=5+7`` from the code chunk above? Can you still knit?
