I have found that there are times when I am doing a complicated statistical analysis but I can only conceptualize the result but not actually actually effectively explain how the conclusion was reached (hence what each part of the analysis represents and means). Thus, I believe this course will be extraordinarily helpful in allowing me to simultaneously grow in statistics and become a better neuroscientist. Also, because of the number of the variables my experiments are reaching, it is becoming increasingly important that my statistical analyses can be very customized,  which requires a strong understanding of programming in R, which I hope to also get out of this course. ","I am very interested in politics, so I think the most common place I have seen statistics used outside of neuroscience and biology is politics. It is common that on the news and certain specialized websites, statistics will be utilized to predict the likelihood of a particular candidate winning an election. Statistics is also used to determine the margin of error in all of the polls. ","I am most interested in analyzing biologically relevant data sets, specifically in the field of neuroscience. I have previously worked on statistical analysis of data sets from gene expression using qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC).

I am however also genuinely interested in statistics and would like to go more in-depth into the subject than AP Stats did.,"A couple weeks ago I was looking at polls for the upcoming presidential election on FiveThirtyEight, and it's really interesting how the models boil the likelihood of each candidate winning down to a single number. This interested me because the inherent flaws of polling in the real world (misrepresentation of public opinion due to response bias, undercoverage, etc.) makes it impossible to draw conclusions for certain, so I'm curious how the model balances and takes into account these variables in order to put forward the best predictions. Also, I liked how the graphs depicted changes in the favorability/approval of parties and individuals over time, with large changes coinciding with notable successes and fiascos.","Average daily screen time

I am also considering a career in clinical/scientific research and would love to understand statistics.,"In my genetics class at Williams, we used Chi-squared tests and scored fly traits to try to understand and map a gene called ""Pentagon"" to the fly genome. I loved being able to take something in the real world (thousands of flies scored by confused sophomores) and translate it into meaningful numbers. The cool thing is that the findings are being used by a lab at Williams to understand the fly genome.

Splits are recorded for each lab in track, or based on miles in cross country, and an average race time is calculated. This helps to develop paces for training and a lot of times are compared with each other. I find this interesting, as well as the effect external sources can have on the times and the results which is similar to finding biases in samples for a study.
