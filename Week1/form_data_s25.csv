","I remember that the week before the 2024 presidential election, there were an incredible number of swing state polls that put either candidate winning at no more than +1 points. Additionally, the majority of forecasters published election projections where the seven swing states were often split 4-3. I think this was because there was overwhelming pressure to not deviate from the majority of polls/projections despite evidence that either candidate sweeping the swing states was more likely than the swing states being split. This would probably be because the state-specific factors altering votes (e.g. the large Arab-American population in Michigan, laws curbing voter access in Georgia) would ultimately be less powerful than national-level trends the polls didn't adequately weight for (e.g. perceptions of the economy).",I would be most interested in analyzing polls (especially political ones) and sports-related statistics (especially baseball ones).

The statistics go against our natural human instinct that community is safe, highlighting the notion that we are inherently bad at understanding probabilities. Not only do I find this interesting, but it also angers me that lawmakers are not more cognizant of the threat of domestic abuse. ","While I don't have much experience working with them, I am really interested in analyzing/learning how to analyze text datasets. I took an amazing cryptography class in high school and I think that text datasets would be a cool way to tackle the subject. Additionally, I am a humanities girl at heart, so analyzing language and communication is a passion of mine. I read and write a lot of poetry, especially in other languages, so the translation application of text datasets is also very interesting to me.

I absolutely loved it and I see the value in taking statistics classes as someone who has to constantly handle data in my major classes. ,"Recently, at a bakery, a sign read, ""80% of our customers start their day with us"". It made me wonder if that number was real or just a clever marketing trick to make people feel like they were part of a popular trend. Also the wording of ""80% of OUR customers"" made me think that maybe we should ask outsiders.

What interested me about this example was that the prediction of the survey wasn’t exactly correct. Additionally, it was also interesting that the sample sizes of these surveys were relatively small (I recall being told by my AP stats teacher that the sample size for these kinds of surveys is around 2000).","I am most interested in analyzing datasets that pertain to politics, although I imagine that I would find other types of datasets interesting as well.",First year,1,AP Statistics,"No, I have no programming experience!",Feel comfortable right now,Feel comfortable right now,Feel comfortable right now,Feel comfortable right now,Feel comfortable right now,Feel comfortable right now,Feel comfortable right now,Feel comfortable right now,Will be comfortable after some reivew,Will be comfortable after some reivew,Feel comfortable right now,Feel comfortable right now,Feel comfortable right now,Feel comfortable right now,Will be comfortable after some reivew,Heard of it but not comfortable,"I am nervous about learning how to properly use R, as I have no experience with it at all.","Wednesday 7-8, Thursday 8-10, Sunday 7-9, Monday 9-10",,"Mondays 9-10am, Mondays 1pm-2:30pm, Thursdays 10am-12pm., Thursdays 1pm-2:30pm., Fridays 9am-10am, Fridays 1pm-2:30pm",2,7.5,10,7,72,No,Yes,Tunnel,Paresky,Yes,Sawyer side

The statistics was used to show that there was increased self reported worker productivity and decreased collaboration and companies used this to either support or tear down remote initiatives.
